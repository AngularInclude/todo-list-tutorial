# Forms

As you've probably noticed, there is always more than one way to implement a solution for a feature. This is what makes programming exciting and code open to collaboration and discussion.

Today you will learn another approach to handle data-entry tasks- forms.

Angular supports **template-driven** and **reactive** forms to help developers work with a form's input elements. Each form type has its advantages and disadvantages so it's good to understand the differences and why you use one type over another.

Please take a moment to read about Angular forms from [angular.io](https://angular.io/guide/forms-overview).

If you are already familiar with **template-driven** and **reactive** forms in Angular, we recommend refreshing your memory so that we can all approach the next steps in the tutorial on the same footing.

Please feel free to take the time you need to familiarize yourself with Angular forms and make notes as necessary. Mentors are happy to answer any questions.
