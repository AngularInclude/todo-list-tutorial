# \#12: ðŸš§ Refactor App Component

We're going to perform a small refactoring. The `todo-root` shouldn't have such a large template and all this logic. It should just call another component that will deal with that.

* Create a new component called `list-manager` and configure inline-template.
* Move the code from `AppComponent` to `ListManagerComponent`. \(Be careful not to change the list manager component's class name!\)
* Call the new component from the `AppComponent` template:

{% code-tabs %}
{% code-tabs-item title="app.component.ts" %}
```typescript
  template: `
    <todo-list-manager></todo-list-manager>
  `,
```
{% endcode-tabs-item %}
{% endcode-tabs %}

That's it! Now we can go on.
