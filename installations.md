# Installation

Every developer needs a set of tools and libraries to start working. In our case, we'll use the online editor [Stackblitz](https://stackblitz.com/).

For this please follow these two steps:

1. Register to [Github](https://github.com)
2. Github provides you a social login. So if you want to register to stackblitz, you can simply use your github account.
3. Choose in the section "START A NEW PROJECT" of the stackblitz page the button for Angular on the left.

You should see a page like this:

### Congratulations!

You have a running Angular application!

Now we're ready to start developing!

## About the Tools

### Github
[Github](https://github.com/) is an online plattform which provides an online management of the version control software Git.

### Git
Git is a tool that helps you manage versions of your code and work in collaboration with team members. There is a lot to know about it, but in this tutorial we will cover only basic usage.

### Stackblitz
Stackblitz is an online editor which provides you all the functionality of the Editor Visual Studio Code and the Angular-CLI.

### Angular-CLI

[Angular-CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) is a powerful tool that simplifies a lot of the development process. It also installs libraries you'll use in your current and future projects. Stackblitz has it integrated out of the box, which makes it more easier for you.
