# Installations

Every developer needs a set of tools and libraries to start working. In our case, we'll use the online editor [Stackblitz](https://stackblitz.com/).

For this please follow these three steps:

1. Register to [Github](https://github.com)
2. Github provides you a social login. So if you want to register to stackblitz, you can simply use your github account.
3. Choose in the section "START A NEW PROJECT" on the left of the stackblitz page the button for Angular.

You should see a page like this:

That's how stackblitz works

**important** Please use the following sample as your basis. Just click the Fork-Button to create a copy to your account: [https://stackblitz.com/github/angularbootcamp/todo-list-tutorial-steps/tree/step-01\_Installations](https://stackblitz.com/github/angularbootcamp/todo-list-tutorial-steps/tree/step-01_Installations)

### Congratulations!

You have a running Angular application!

Now we're ready to start developing!

## About the Tools

### Github

[GitHub](https://github.com/) is a code repository website that integrates with **Git**. It allows you to publish your project on the Web, copy other open source projects, and collaborate. To be able to publish your project, make sure you create a user in GitHub's website \(for free, of course\).

### Git

Git is a tool that helps you manage versions of your code and collaborate with team members. There is a lot to know about it, but in this tutorial we will cover only basic usage.

### Stackblitz

Stackblitz is an online editor which provides you all the functionality of an Online-**IDE** called **Visual Studio Code** and the **Angular-CLI**.

### Angular-CLI

[Angular-CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) is a powerful tool that simplifies a lot of the development process. It also installs libraries you'll use in your current and future projects. Stackblitz has it integrated out of the box, which makes it more easier for you.

### IDE

Our next tool is the **IDE** , or integrated development environment. It's software that helps you write the code. IDEs can do a lot of amazing things, such as:

* highlight the code so it's easier to identify expressions
* suggest completions to what you type
* help you navigate easily through the files in your project
* and a lot more...

### Visual Studio Code

Microsoft [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is an editor that's gained a lot of popularity lately. It is completely free for individuals.
