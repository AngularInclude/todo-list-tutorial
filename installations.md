# Installation

Every developer needs a set of tools and libraries to start working. In our case, we'll use the online editor [Stackblitz](https://stackblitz.com/).

For this follow these two steps:

1. Register to [Github](https://github.com)
2. Github provides you a social login. So if you want to register to stackblitz, you can simply use your github account.

**Github**
Github is an online plattform which provides an online management of the version control software Git.

**Stackblitz**
Stackblitz is an online editor which provides you all the functionality of the Editor Visual Studio Code and of the Angular-CLI.

You should see a page like this:

You have a running Angular application!

Now we're ready to start developing!
