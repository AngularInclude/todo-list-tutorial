# Gallery with Rx.js

Hi there! If you’re reading this I know you’ve already built some web applications and it went pretty well! You know how to store and display data. You know how to react to user events and communicate with servers. Even styling your applications gets easier every time you do it!

Today we’ll dig deeper into managing user and server interaction. With Rx.js you’ll take control of time in your application. You’ll create Observables to easily merge, filter, and synchronize events happening in your application. Let’s go!

By the end of that tutorial you will have the working photo gallery which allows you to upload your own photos and categorize them. The preview of final app is available [here](https://stackblitz.com/github/jonki/observable-gallery/tree/master/examples/3_05-add-photo-to-category/).

PS. You may want to check RxJS documentation from time to time. Go for [https://rxjs.dev/api](https://rxjs.dev/api). [https://rxmarbles.com](https://rxmarbles.com) may also be useful. Also library called Ramda is used here few times. In need of explanation go here: [https://ramdajs.com/docs/](https://ramdajs.com/docs/)
