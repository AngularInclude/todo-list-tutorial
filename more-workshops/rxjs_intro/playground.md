# Play time!

For playing a bit with RxJS we will use ready app \(but you may develop this one by yourself if you wish - [Instructions in here](https://ng-girls.gitbook.io/todo-list-tutorial/more-workshops/hello)\)

> You may either clone the [repository](https://github.com/ng-girls/todo-list-tutorial) and find needed application state under `/examples/3_05-add-photo-to-category` or you may work on [StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/github/jonki/observable-gallery/tree/master/examples/3_05-add-photo-to-category/).

Find all the **Operators** used in the code. Check documentation of each one. Find them on [RxMarbles](https://rxmarbles.com/). Discuss them with mentor and other attendees. Make notes, jot down questions you have.

Do you understand what they are doing? :thinking:

Now try to break something! :boom: Change operators, unsubscribe in some places, remove subscribe somewhere. Play with the app a little bit :stuck\_out\_tongue\_winking\_eye:

When you finish you may go back to the `Todo list app` you've created. Find all the places where you are using Observables and other RxJS related code. Try to understand each one - discuss it with mentor and other attendees if needed :speech\_balloon:

I know this tutorial may seem boring a bit, but thinking and walking through ready code is also useful when learning something. :yellow\_heart:

This time we have great oportunity to have Q&A session about RxJS with Jan-Niklas and about programming, Angular and all you may think of with all the mentors and other attendees. Whenever you feel ready for this Q&A session please let your mentor know :relaxed:
